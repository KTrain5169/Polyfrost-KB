Welcome new mods or anyone encountering this page.



1.8.9 is almost [8 years old](https://howoldisminecraft189.today) as of 2023, so you might imagine support for Minecraft mods has improved in that time period. However, this is definitely not the case.



Support for mods is currently all over the place, across all platforms - users need to find the right discord, then be expected to explain a problem that the average user probably does not have the ability to, then have a day response time just for a sassy response from a salty dev.



This knowledgebase is part of our bigger mission to raise the bar for Minecraft support. As you may know, a core part of Polyfrost is to provide an unparalleled user experience; although it'd be great for users never to have to reach out for support in the first place, users will probably have an issue once in a while.



This guide contains how to handle a ticket, how to troubleshoot virtually every issue a user may have, when to pass it on to a dev or someone higher, etc.
